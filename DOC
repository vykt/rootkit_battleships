See the block comment on top of each file for overview. Briefly:

1) Battleships.sh runs menu.py

2) menu.py progresses the user through 3 or so main menues, consisting
   of setting up the game and the game itself. Loading a savefile causes
   the progression to take a slightly different, shorter route.

3) The menues call upon draw.py for major print statements and drawing
   maps.

4) player.py is used to set up data for the player and the bot.

5) map.py is probably the most complex, it handles all operations on the
   maps, both of player and bot. Both bot and player share most of these
   functions.

6) save.py handles savefiles.

7) game.py just checks for victory conditions. Its use is expanded in
   Battleships online.
